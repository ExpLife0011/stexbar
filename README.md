#StExBar: The ultimate tool for Windows Explorer
Or what Microsoft forgot to implement in the Windows Explorer.
#What is it?
StExBar provides many useful commands for your everyday use of Windows explorer. And you can add as many custom commands on your own as you like.
The commands are not just available from the toolbar, but also via hotkeys and via a context menu!
#Functions
* ''console'' : open a console window anywhere
* ''copy name or full path'' : provides two commands, one to copy all selected file/foldernames to the clipboard, the other copies the whole paths of all selected items. To make it even more easier to use this, a hotkey is defined Ctrl+Shift+C which copies the selected paths.
* ''new folder'' : one easy click to a new folder created in the current directory
* ''multirename'' : renaming multiple files at once. It uses Regular Expression strings to do so.
* You can add your own commands to StExBar and define hotkeys for them
